description: "Employing an extensive flight tracking data set (Flightradar24), we assess the interflight variability in CO2 emissions from global aviation with unprecedented spatial and temporal granularity. We develop reduced-form models for over two hundred standard aircraft types that capture flight-to-flight variability."

Employing an extensive flight tracking data set (Flightradar24), we assess the interflight variability in CO2 emissions from global aviation with unprecedented spatial and temporal granularity. We develop reduced-form models for over two hundred standard aircraft types that capture flight-to-flight variability.
